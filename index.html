"description":"Peterson Acquisitions is the #1 business brokerage in the country. Our aggressive, non-traditional approach gets deals done. Did you know the industry average is only around 20% for actually selling a business when it is listed. Thats terrible and unacceptable. We know how to get deals done. We help both business buyers and people looking to sell their business. We have an educational company that helps first-timers. Getting deals done often means helping people line up financing. We have decades of behind the scenes experience with former SBA lendors on time. And our Quantum Stack Investing™ method multiplies income and wealth returns for the owners of closely held businesses. Contact us to learn more!

<p><p>&nbsp;Peterson Acquisitions is the #1 business brokerage in the country. Our aggressive, non-traditional approach gets deals done. Did you know the industry average is only around 20% for actually selling a business when it is listed. That&#39;s terrible and unacceptable. We know how to get deals done. We help both business buyers and people looking to sell their business. We have an educational company that helps first-timers. Getting deals done often means helping people line up financing. We have decades of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; experience with former SBA lendors on time. And our Quantum Stack Investing&trade; method multiplies income and wealth returns for the owners of closely held businesses. Contact us to learn more!</p></p>
